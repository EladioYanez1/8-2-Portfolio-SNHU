1.) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client was someone who wanted my team to design the basic functionality of their game idea "Draw it or Lose it," to code various aspects about the project to ensure it worked, to outline the best operating systems for it to work in, to see the sort of methods it needed to be a successful game, and so on. They wanted us to design the enviorment where their game would work.

2.) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did pretty well in exploring the design constraints of the project and what we would need to work around to ensure a successful experience for the clients. 

3.) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was mostly about referring to the speciic design outlines of the UML diagram and how we'd enforce the functionaity of the UML program to code based on my knowledge from previous courses regarding coding.

3.) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I wished I did a better job in exploring the recommendations I gave to the client, I felt as if I was a bit out of my depth on the topic in some regards (specifically in regards to the "Distrbuted System and Networks" portion) and I wished I was more informed on the topic.

4.) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I went with the generality that they wanted to have an affordable product that could catch success, so I wanted to highlight accessibility as a major part of my design sheet.

5.) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I tried to keep into consideration what would help make the program intutive for a user to experience when designing the software, because I felt like that would allow for the game to catch on a lot easier than if I went for something more complex on the user level.
